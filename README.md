## Brahms, Sonata for Clarinet (or Viola) and Piano, Opus 120

The Brahms sonatas are core literature for clarinetists and violists.  These computer engravings attempt to reproduce very closely the engraving of one of the early editions of the sonata, but allows the work to be altered, re-arranged, transposed, or otherwise used by people in the future.  The printouts in the PDFs are also clearer than the early prints (which have been reprinted and rescanned many times).

Different files have different licenses.  As the main computer engraving strove to reproduce as exactly as possible without creative adjustments an out-of-copyright source, it too should be considered Public Domain (or if not possible, released as a CC-0 license, which is nearly the same).  

Other arrangments that may appear here in the future retain copyright protection and are released under a CC-SA-BY license.  The license in any file supercedes the "LICENSE" documentation given here.

Only Sonata no. 1 is complete at this time.
